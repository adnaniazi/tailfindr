## What is *tailfindr*?

tailfindr is a R package for estimating poly(A)-tail lengths in Oxford Nanopore reads. 

## Features of *tailfindr*

* Works for both RNA and DNA reads. In the case of DNA reads, it estimates both poly(A)- and poly(T)-tail lengths.
* Supports data that has been basecalled with Albacore or Guppy. It also support data that has been basecalled using the newer 'flipflop' model.
* Can work on single or multi-fast5 file reads.

*tailfindr* has been developed at [Valen Lab](https://www.cbu.uib.no/valen/) in [Computational Biology Unit](https://www.cbu.uib.no/) at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/), Norway.

## Installation

#### Step 1. Installing HDF5 library

tailfindr depends on the HDF5 library for reading Fast5 files. For OS X and Linux, the HDF5 library needs to be installed via one of the (shell) commands specified below:

| System                                    | Command
|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|**OS X (using Homebrew)**                  | `brew install hdf5`
|**Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)**| `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev` 
|**Systems supporting yum and RPMs**        | `sudo yum install hdf5-devel`

HDF5 1.8.14 has been pre-compiled for Windows and is available [here](https://github.com/mannau/h5-libwin) &mdash; thus no manual installation is required.

#### Step 2. Installing devtools
Currently, *tailfindr* is not listed on CRAN/Bioconductor, so you need to install it using `devtools`. To install `devtools` use the following command in R/R-studio:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

#### Step 3. Installing tailfindr

Now you can install tailfindr using the command below in R/R-studio:
````{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("adnaniazi/tailfindr")
```
If you also want to build the vignette while installing tailfindr, then run the command below:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github('adnaniazi/tailfindr', build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), force = TRUE)
```

Now you are ready to use *tailfindr*.

## Usage

#### 1. Minimal working example

`find_tails()` is the main function that you can use to find tail lengths in both RNA and DNA reads. It saves a CSV file containing all the tail-length data. Furthermore, it also returns the same data as a tibble. 

Give below is a minimal use case in which we will run tailfindr on example RNA reads present in the tailfindr package. 

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tailfindr)
df <- find_tails(fast5_dir = system.file('extdata', 'rna', package = 'tailfindr'),
                 save_dir = '~/Downloads',
                 csv_filename = 'rna_tails.csv',
                 num_cores = 2)
```
In the above example, *tailfindr* returns a tibble containing the tail data which is then stored in the variable `df`. tailfindr also saves this dataframe as a csv file (`rna_tails.csv`) in the user-specified `save_dir`, which in this case is set to `~/Downloads`. A logfile is also saved in the `save_dir`. The parameter `num_cores` can be increased depending on the number of *physical* cores at your disposal.

#### 2. Plotting the tail

Additionally, *tailfindr* allows you to generate plots that show the tail location in the raw squiggle. You can save these plots as interactive `.html` files by using `'rbokeh'` as the `plotting_library`. You can zoom in on the tail region in the squiggle and see the exact location of the tail.

Give below is a minimal use case in which we will run tailfindr on example cDNA reads present in the tailfindr package, and also save the plots:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
df <- find_tails(fast5_dir = system.file('extdata', 'cdna', package = 'tailfindr'),
                 save_dir = '~/Downloads',
                 csv_filename = 'cdna_tails.csv',
                 num_cores = 2,
                 save_plots = TRUE,
                 plotting_library = 'rbokeh')
```
![Poly(T) read squiggle plot](https://github.com/adnaniazi/tailfindr/raw/master/man/figures/poly_t_without_debug.gif)

However, note that generating plots can slow down the performance of tailfindr. We recommend that you generate these plots only for a small subset of your reads.

#### 3. Plotting the tail and debug traces

*tailfindr* can plot additional information that it used while deriving the tail boundaries. Please read our preprint to learn how *tailfindr* works. To plot this information, set the `plot_debug_traces` parameter to `TRUE`.
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
df <- find_tails(fast5_dir = system.file('extdata', 'cdna', package = 'tailfindr'),
                 save_dir = '~/Downloads',
                 csv_filename = 'cdna_tails.csv',
                 num_cores = 2,
                 save_plots = TRUE,
                 plot_debug_traces = TRUE,
                 plotting_library = 'rbokeh')
```

#### 4. Specifying custom basecall group
*tailfindr* needs `Fastq` and `Events/Move` table to work on. By default, it searches for them in the `Basecall_1D_000` group in the Analyses section of the FAST5 file. If for whatever reason, you need *tailfindr* to read data from another basecall group -- lets say `Basecall_1D_001` -- then you can run *tailfindr* as below:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
df <- find_tails(fast5_dir = system.file('extdata', 'rna_basecall_1D_001', package = 'tailfindr'),
                 save_dir = '~/Downloads',
                 csv_filename = 'rna_tails.csv',
                 num_cores = 2,
                 basecall_group = 'Basecall_1D_001',
                 save_plots = TRUE,
                 plot_debug_traces = TRUE,
                 plotting_library = 'rbokeh')
```
In this case, the input FAST5 have two basecall groups: `Basecall_1D_000` and `Basecall_1D_001` but we configured *tailfindr* to use `Events/Move` table from the `Basecall_1D_001` group.

There are more options available in the find_tails() function. Please see its [documentation](https://rdrr.io/github/adnaniazi/tailfindr/man/find_tails.html). 

#### 5. Specifying custom cDNA primers

If you have used custom front and end primers while designing you cDNA sequences, you can now specify them in *tailfindr*. *tailfindr* will use these sequences instead of the defaults ones to find the orientation of the reads and one of the ends of the poly(A)/(T) tail. Here is how you call *tailfindr* if you have used custom primers:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
df <- find_tails(fast5_dir = system.file('extdata', 'cdna', package = 'tailfindr'),
                 save_dir = '~/Downloads/tailfindr_output',
                 csv_filename = 'cdna_tails.csv',
                 num_cores = 4,
                 dna_datatype = 'custom-cdna',
                 front_primer = "TTTCTGTTGGTGCTGATATTGCTGCCATTACGGCCGG",
                 end_primer = "ACTTGCCTGTCGCTCTATCTT")
```

Important thing to note here is the use of three additional parameters: `dna_datatype`, `front_primer`, and `end_primer`.

`front_primer` and `end_primer` sequences should always be specified in the 5' to 3' direction.

### Description of the CSV/Dataframe columns
*tailfindr* returns tail data in a dataframe and also saves this information in a user-specified CSV file. The columns generated depend on the whether *tailfindr* was run on RNA or DNA data. Below is a description of columns for both thses scenarios:

##### When input data is RNA

| Column Names   | Datatype  | Description                                                                                                |
|:---------------|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read_id        | character | Read ID as given in the Fast5 file                                                                         |
| tail_start     | numeric   | Sample index of start site of the tail in raw data                                                         |
| tail_end       | numeric   | Sample index of end site of the tail in raw data                                                           |
| samples_per_nt | numeric   | Read rate in terms of samples per nucleotide                                                               |
| tail_length    | numeric   | Tail length in nucleotides. It is the difference between `tail_end` and `tail_start` divided by `samples_per_nt` |
| file_path      | character | Absolute path of the Fast5 file                                                                            |

##### When input data is DNA
Here are the columns that you will get from *tailfindr* if you have run it on DNA data:

| Column Names   | Datatype         | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read_id        | character        | Read ID as given in the Fast5 file                                                                                                                                                |
| read_type      | character factor | Whether a read is `"polyA"`, `"polyT"`, or `"invalid"`. Invalid reads are those in which *tailfindr* wasn't able to find Nanopore primers with high confidence.                           |
| tail_is_valid  | logical          | Whether a poly(A) tail is a full-length read or not. This is important because a poly(A) tail is at the end of the read, and premature termination of reads is prevelant in cDNA. |
| tail_start     | numeric          | Sample index of start site of the tail in raw data                                                                                                                                |

| samples_per_nt | numeric          | Read rate in terms of samples per nucleotide                                                                                                                                      |
| tail_length    | numeric          | Tail length in nucleotides. It is the difference between `tail_end` and `tail_start` divided by `samples_per_nt`                                                                        |

## The devil👹 in the details

* tailfindr needs the `Events/Move` table in the FAST5 file to calculate the read-specific normalizer -- `samples_per_nt` -- which is used to convert tail length in samples to tail length in nucleotides. If your data was basecalled with *MinKNOW-Live-Basecalling*, then the Events/Move table might not be saved in the FAST5 file. In such a case, you can rebasecall your reads and adjust the `basecall_group` parameter accordingly when calling `find_tails()` function as demonstrated in the use case # 4 above. This is because now the Events/Move table will now be under `Basecall_1D_001` instead of  *tailfindr's* default search location `Basecall_1D_000`. See the figure below: The panel on left shows that the MinKNOW live basecalled read; it has no Event/Move table. The panel on the right shows the same read after it has been re-basecalled using standalone Guppy. Now there is Event/Move table under the freshly-added basaecall group (`Basecall_1D_001`). `find_tails()`  should be called with `basecall_group` set to `"Basecall_1D_001"` as shown in the use case # 4 above.

</center>


* For DNA data, *tailfindr* decides whether a read is poly(A) or poly(T) based on finding Nanopore primers/adaptors. If you are using the flipflop model to basecall DNA data, please ensure that the nanopore adaptors are not trimmed off while basecalling. This can be done by turning off `enabling_trimming` option in the basecalling script. The script below shows you how we have basecalled our reads using the flipflop model

```{r, engine='bash', message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#!/bin/sh
INPUT=/raw/fast5/files/path/
OUTPUT=/output/folder/path/
guppy_basecaller \
    --config dna_r9.4.1_450bps_flipflop.cfg \
    --input $INPUT \
    --save_path $OUTPUT \
    --recursive \
    --fast5_out \
    --hp_correct 1 \
    --disable_pings 1 \
    --enable_trimming 0 
```

* *tailfindr* has been tested and validated using the following sequencing kits:
1. SQK-RNA001 and SQK-RNA002 for RNA 
2. SQK-LSK108 and SQK-LSK109 for DNA

* *tailfindr* has been tested and validated using the basecallers:
1. Albacore v2.3.1 and v2.3.3.
2. Guppy v2.2.2, v2.3.1, v3.0.1. Guppy v2.2.2, v2.3.1 were tested with flipflop basecalling for DNA, and Guppy v3.0.1 was tested with flipflop basecalling for RNA.
